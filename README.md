## Max_Pooling
```
    This Python script performs Max_Pooling operation on a given (m × m) matrix with a specified (k × k) moving window size.
```
### Prerequisites

```
    Python 3.x
    Numpy
    setup tools
```
### How to run
```
    1.Save the provided code in a file named Max_Pooling.py.
    2.Open your terminal or command prompt.
    3.Navigate to the directory where max_pooling.py is saved.
    4.Run the script using Python by typing:
        python Max_pooling.py
```
```
    When prompted, enter the size of the matrix (m) and the window size (k).
     For example:
                5
                2
```
### Input
```
    m = Size of the matrix
    k = Size of the moving window
```
### Output
```
    The Script prints the randomly generated matrix, then prints the result of the Max pooling operation.
    For Example :-
        Input Matrix:
            [[9 9 4 2]
            [0 0 6 8]
            [6 5 9 0]
            [2 3 6 0]]
        Max Pooling Output:
            [[9. 9. 8.]
            [6. 9. 9.]
            [6. 9. 9.]] 
```
